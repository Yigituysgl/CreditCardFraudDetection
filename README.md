Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms
This project implements a **Credit Card Fraud Detection** system using machine learning algorithms. The objective is to identify fraudulent credit card transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset. Several machine learning models were used to compare performance, and feature importance analysis was conducted for insights.
-The dataset was highly imbalanced, requiring oversampling techniques like SMOTE for effective training.
- XGBoost performed the best overall, with the highest **ROC-AUC score of 0.98**.
- Feature `V14` was identified as the most important predictor of fraud across models.
